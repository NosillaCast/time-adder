Time Adder will allow users to enter elapsed time values and calculate the sum of the elapsed times.  New rows can be added to allow for more times to be added. If desired, on a row by row basis, time values can be subtracted from the sum.

Total elapsed time will be calculated simply by adding up the number of seconds in each row and adding/subtracting them from the total.
