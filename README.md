Time Adder Is designed to allow users to enter multiple elapsed time values in hours, minutes and seconds and calculate the sum of the elapsed times.  New rows can be added to allow for more times to be added. If desired, on a row by row basis, time values can be subtracted rather than added to to the total.

Total elapsed time will be calculated simply by adding up the number of seconds in each row and adding/subtracting them from the total.

Future goals include storing of values.
